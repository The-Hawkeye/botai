      "id": 1,
      "question": "What's the difference between GET and POST requests?",
      "response": "GET requests are used to retrieve data from the server, and are visible in the URL. POST requests are used to send data to the server to create/update resources, and the data is included in the body of the request, not visible in the URL."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Can you explain RESTful APIs?",
      "response": "RESTful APIs are designed around the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, which uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. They follow a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol."

    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "How do you manage state in a Redux application?",
      "response": "In a Redux application, state is managed through a single immutable state tree, called the store. Actions are dispatched to describe what happened, and reducers specify how the state changes in response to these actions."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What are hooks in React?",
      "response": "Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. They provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "Explain serverless architecture.",
      "response": "Serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Applications are broken down into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled independently."

    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What is a websocket?",
      "response": "WebSockets provide a bidirectional, full-duplex communication channel that operates over a single, long-lived connection. They enable real-time data flow between clients and servers, ideal for web applications requiring constant data exchange."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "How do you ensure code quality?",
      "response": "Ensuring code quality involves practices like regular code reviews, unit and integration testing, adhering to coding standards, and using static code analysis tools to detect potential issues early."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What is continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)?",
      "response": "CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. CI refers to the automated testing of the application with each code change, while CD automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?",
      "response": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web capabilities to provide a user experience similar to that of mobile apps. They aim to combine the benefits of the web and mobile apps, working offline, fast loading times, and access to device features."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "Explain the concept of dependency injection.",
      "response": "Dependency injection is a design pattern in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies. Instead of creating them inside the object, they are passed in as parameters, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "What is TypeScript and why use it?",
      "response": "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. Using TypeScript helps catch errors early through its type-checking feature, and makes the codebase more readable and maintainable."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "How do you manage application secrets?",
      "response": "Application secrets, like API keys and passwords, should be managed securely using environment variables or secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to keep them out of the source code."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "What is NoSQL and when would you use it?",
      "response": "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for large-scale data storage and for massively-parallel, high-performance data processing across a large number of commodity servers. They are used when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data, where the scalability and performance requirements exceed the capabilities of traditional relational databases."

    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "Explain how you would use Docker in your development workflow.",
      "response": "Docker can be used in development to create a consistent environment that mirrors production, ensuring that applications run the same, regardless of where they are deployed. It simplifies the management of dependencies and makes it easy to test and deploy applications in isolated containers."
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "question": "What are environmental variables and why are they important?",
      "response": "Environmental variables are key-value pairs in the operating system used to store data that varies between environments, such as API keys, database passwords, and file paths. They are important for security and configurability, allowing applications to run differently in development, testing, and production environments without code changes."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Describe the concept of immutability in programming.",
      "response": "Immutability in programming means that once an object is created, it cannot be modified. This helps to avoid side effects, makes the code easier to reason about, and improves performance in some contexts, especially in concurrent programming."
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "question": "What are some common REST API status codes?",
      "response": "Common REST API status codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 204 (No Content), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error). These codes provide information about the result of the HTTP request."
